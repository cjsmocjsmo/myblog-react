const MovieGo1Txt = ` was written in `

const MovieGo2Txt = ` and is primarily meant to be used on the `

const MovieGo3Txt = `.  MovieCenter was written to solve three
main problems.  Problem #1 is the inherent limited storage capability
of the Raspberry Pi (64GB).  This is unacceptable as I have 8TB of video
and audio file to organize and serve up so some type of streaming solution
is needed.  Problem #2 the crappy video playback from most if not all the video
players CPU based players out in the wild.  `

const MovieGo4Txt = `  is a GPU video player that was written in
C++ especially for the Raspberry Pis  Broadcoms VideoCore chipset with near DVD
video quality playback in my opinion. Problem #3 my poor TV is dumber than a box
of rocks and has no smart capabilities this is where the Raspberry Pi comes in.
It is a cheap way of turning my dumb TV into a "smarter" one.  MediaCenter's is
a natural progression of MovieGo and TvGo and is a mashup of both projects.  
The front end was developed with HTML5, Bootstrap4, JQuery.  While `

const MovieGo5Txt = `  and GoLang organizes and serves up your media files.  
MovieGo can be accessed from any device that has a web browser, I find that an
old phone can be used as a MovieGo remote control.`
